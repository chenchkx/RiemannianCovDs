Riemannian covariance descriptors(RieCovDs) via covariance computation on the manifold of Gaussians for image set coding. 
Written by Kai-Xuan Chen (e-mail: chenkx.jsh@aliyun.com,  chenkx@zju.edu.cn)  


The ETH-80 dataset is needed to be downloaded(https://github.com/Kai-Xuan/ETH-80/),  
and put 8 filefolders(visual image sets from 8 different categories) into filefolder '.\ETH-80\'.  
Please run 'read_ETH.m' to generate RieCovDs. Then run 'run_ETH_NNMethods.m' and 'run_ETH_DisMethods.m' for image set classification.
